This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/claude-code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a static HTML-based multilingual terms of service website for SwimPilot, deployed via GitHub Pages at https://ooosyooo.github.io/swimpilot-terms. The site serves Apple App Store compliance requirements by providing terms of service in 10 languages.

## Architecture

**Language Detection & Routing**
- `index.html` detects browser language via `navigator.language` and redirects to the appropriate language file
- Language detection logic covers 10 languages with regional variants (e.g., `zh-TW`/`zh-HK` → `zh-Hant.html`, `zh-CN`/`zh-SG` → `zh-Hans.html`)
- Defaults to English (`en.html`) for unrecognized languages

**HTML Structure (All Language Files)**
Each language file (`ko.html`, `en.html`, `ja.html`, `zh-Hans.html`, `zh-Hant.html`, `es.html`, `fr.html`, `de.html`, `pt.html`, `ru.html`) follows identical structure:
- Sticky header with SwimPilot logo
- Sidebar navigation with table of contents
- Main content area with 5 sections:
  1. Service Overview (features, premium features)
  2. Subscription & Billing (monthly/annual subscriptions, auto-renewal)
  3. Refund Policy (Apple App Store process)
  4. Privacy Protection (data collection, storage, deletion)
  5. Contact Information
- Responsive design with mobile breakpoint at 768px
- Client-side smooth scrolling and active section highlighting

**Styling**
- Embedded CSS using Apple-inspired design system
- CSS variables for colors (primary: `#0071e3`, text colors, backgrounds)
- Apple system fonts: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI'`
- Mobile: horizontal scrolling navigation, simplified layout

## Content Requirements (App Store Compliance)

When modifying content, ensure ALL language files maintain these required sections:
- Subscription details (monthly/annual, auto-renewal, cancellation process)
- Refund policy with link to Apple support (https://reportaproblem.apple.com)
- Privacy information (data collection, storage locations for free vs premium users)
- Contact email: ooosyooo@gmail.com
- Disclaimer that app is fitness tool, not medical device
- Last updated date at bottom

## Deployment
